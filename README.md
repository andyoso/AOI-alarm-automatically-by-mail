# AOI-alarm-automatically-by-mail
Array面板前段，由AOI檢測後人工複判並為其defect上名字，當某defect code超過規格，系統發出mail通知工程師做機台確認，嚴重者則立馬停機

In the Array panel process, after AOI detects defects, they are reviewed manually and given defect names. If a defect code exceeds the spec limit, the system sends an email to notify engineers to check the machine. For serious cases, the system stops the machine immediately.
